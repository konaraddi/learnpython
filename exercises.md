Dear Alfred,

    I'm writing this letter with the purpose of writing
a letter addressed to you, complete with most, if not all,
parts that a letter should be composed of, should it be
of the utmost highest caliber of a letter.

                                        Bucky

Then make a `tuple` of all your favorite hobbies.
Combine these `tuples`, and call it `favorites`. Print them all out.

* Make a `tuple` of all the TV shows or movies you've watched this year. Then figure out how many TV shows or movies you've watched (hint: you don't need to count them yourself!)

* Now do the last 2 exercises, but using a `list` this time. Then remove the last item from each `list`, using an additional line of code.

### time.py

* Write a real compelling story, maybe with dialogue too

### 005 User Input

* Ask the user for their first, middle, and last name. Print their full name.

* Ask the user for two numbers. Print the average.

* Make a fortune teller. Ask the user if they would like to hear a fortune, then give them a random fortune. Once a fortune is given, ask the user if they would like to hear another one and repeat.

* Make a guess-the-number game. Generate the number randomly. Tell the user if they it's too high or too low after each guess.

### 008 & 009 Functions

**Make a flowchart of these before you begin to write code.**

* Function for finding the average of numbers passed into it

* Print the Fibonacci sequence until the Nth number where N is a number specified by the user
    * Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 14
