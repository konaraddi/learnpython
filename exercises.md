# Exercises for Students
###### Solutions for these exercises are in the `solutions/` folder

You can't learn without practice.

### 001 Hello World

* Print your name
* Print today's date
* Print a sentence

### 002 Variables

* Make a variable called `age` that is set to your actual age. Then print your age using the variable `age`.
* Make a variable called `am_i_awesome`, set it to `true`, and print the variable.
* Make your own `greeting` and print it out.

### 003 Expressions

* Calculate:
    * 72 x 234 x 12
    * Remainder of 6439 divided by 6

* Print "twelve" 12 times (hint: you don't need to type "twelve" more than once)

* Make a variable containing "rain" and another containing "bow" then add and print them together

* Make `greeting` and `name` variables and then use those variables to print "Good Afternoon, [insert your name] !"

* Print a few pictures:

```
face
  __  __
   *  *
    <
   |___|

house
    ^
  / O \
 /_____\      
 | X X |     
 |  U  |   
------------

duck
      __
    <(o )___
     ( ._> /
      `---'
```

### 004 Tuples and Lists

* Make two variables:
    * `pirate` that equals "Yee Haw! \*takes off hat and waives it around\*"
    * `cowboy` or `cowgirl` that equals "Argh! Shiver me timbers!" and swap their values

* Make a `tuple` of all your favorite foods.
Then make a `tuple` of all your favorite hobbies.
Combine these `tuples`, and call it `favorites`. Print them all out.

* Make a `tuple` of all the TV shows or movies you've watched this year. Then figure out how many TV shows or movies you've watched (hint: you don't need to count them yourself!)

* Now do the last 2 exercises, but using a `list` this time. Then remove the last item from each `list`, using an additional line of code.

### time.py

* Write a real compelling story, maybe with dialogue too

### 005 User Input

* Ask the user for their first, middle, and last name. Print their full name.

* Ask the user for two numbers. Print the average.

* Ask the user for their pet name and various stats (e.g. Type? Amount of HP? Attack/Defense? Favorite toy?). In the end, print it all out in a neat fashion.

### 006 Decisions

* Ask the user for two numbers. Tell the user which one is bigger or if they are both equal.

* Ask the user how many ninjas are there. Tell the user whether or not they take 'em out or what's
the probability of taking 'em out.

* Make a text-based adventure story/game. **Draw it out on a piece of paper before you begin.**

* Rock, paper, scissor, shoot!

### 007 Loops and Random

**Make a flowchart of these before you begin to write code.**

* Ask the user if they want to roll a dice. If they say yes, roll the dice and display the side of the dice using ASCII art. If they say no, then
cast them into an eternity of doom from which not even light can escape.

* Make a fortune teller. Ask the user if they would like to hear a fortune, then give them a random fortune. Once a fortune is given, ask the user if they would like to hear another one and repeat.

* Make a guess-the-number game. Generate the number randomly. Tell the user if they it's too high or too low after each guess.

### 008 & 009 Functions

**Make a flowchart of these before you begin to write code.**

* Function for finding the average of numbers passed into it

* Print the Fibonacci sequence until the Nth number where N is a number specified by the user
    * Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 14

* Make hangman using functions, loops, random (for choosing a word), and user input.
    * Remember, you can print the hangman each time using a function
        * make the hangman in stick figures first

### 010 Turtle

*Use input for customizing output from turtle*
*Use loops for repetition*
*Use random for colors*
*Use functions for defining & customizing shapes*

* Draw a square, triangle, rectangle, and diamond
* Draw an octagon & a dodecagon (12-sided-polygon)
* Draw a Star (`DrawStar.py`)
* Swiveling shapes around a point with `CircleMagic` (2 circles) 
and `SquareMagic` (use any shape(s))
* Drawing Machine (`DrawingMachine.py`)

### 011 File I/O

* Improve upon the hangman game, by pulling the words from a `words.txt` file instead of a list or tuple
* Write directions for Turtle
